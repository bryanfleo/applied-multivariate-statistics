This was my final scientific paper in the course of Applied Multivariate Statistics instructed by Dr. Abdurakhman, S.Si., M.Si. in 2022. The paper involved the application of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the educational resources and the academic achievements of high school students in Indonesia in 2019.
